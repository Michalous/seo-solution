# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## My Task

This week's challenge was to refactor an existing code to make the site more accessible.

## What's been done?

* Generic divs have been changed to semantic HTML elements
* HTML elements follow a logical structure - no changes here
* Image and icon elements now contain accessible `alt` attributes
* One broken link has been fixed
* Some of CSS selectors have been changed to match HTML semantic elements
